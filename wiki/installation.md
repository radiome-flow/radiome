# Installation

## Stable release

To install radiome, run this command in your terminal:

```
$ pip install radiome
```

This is the preferred method to install radiome, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you donâ€™t have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide
you through the process.
